Simple REST interface to EUDAT services
=======================================

Installation
------------

Required python packages

- flask
- requests
- Flask-SQLAlchemy

Coding Style
------------
Primarily all code has to adhere to PEP8 http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.
We only divert from this using 2 spaces indentation instead of 4 spaces.
This must be followed as well.
